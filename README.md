# How to use...
## Extrabutton2  
The idea is to spam mouse side button 1 (the easiest to reach at the front of the mouse, Extrbutton2) for villagers no matter the context.
The ui is a bit glitchy, but it selects all TCs if not selected already then proceeds to que vils on further button presses at a rate of one per press.  
  
ALSO it gives waypoint control every time the button is pressed, kinda meh feature    
  
ALSO if vills are docked in TC it will ungarisson them before you proceed to q further villagers per press (with right click as garison enabled)
  
## Extrabutton1  
The Extra button one works well with sending vils from TC back to work (with right click as garison enabled)  
it also can be used to cancel the way point being set on the Extrabutton2 spam end,  
when done spamming tap Extrabutton1 keeping current active way point unchanged.

### ((Poles)) to fling food to Saracen elephants via the open market.
True market value is refelcted as +/-5 for Saracens and +/-30 on any other civ -> Food sold by pole player exists to drop food cost on the open market, effectively meaning tribute cost of food is now only a 5% loss not 30% after the huge intial market investment made by pole goes through (1400 food)... note this food can easily be bought by others now.  
    
For (Saracens) Battle Elephant: 120 Food, 70 Gold  
This unit needs market fair price ratio of food:gold to be 100:58 or lower. Any 100 batch of food bought or sold makes changes to market fair price by fixed amount of +/-3, so (100-58)/3 = 1400 food to get this ideal true value price ratio set for a saracen elephant all in gold from the open market.      
  
-> For now castle age 800 food cost can also come from any going rate < 100:58 in the open market too just cus...    
  
Note gold tiles are scarce and can run out for saracen in castle age pretty rapid.
