# How to use...
## Extrabutton2  
The idea is to spam mouse side button 1 (the easiest to reach at the front of the mouse, Extrbutton2) for villagers no matter the context.
The ui is a bit glitchy, but it selects all TCs if not selected already then proceeds to que vils on further button presses at a rate of one per press.  
  
ALSO it gives waypoint control every time the button is pressed, kinda meh feature    
  
ALSO if vills are docked in TC it will ungarisson them before you proceed to q further villagers per press (with right click as garison enabled)
  
## Extrabutton1  
The Extra button one works well with sending vils from TC back to work (with right click as garison enabled)  
it also can be used to cancel the way point being set on the Extrabutton2 spam end,  
when done spamming tap Extrabutton1 keeping current active way point unchanged.
  
### Feudal age Poles to fling food to castle age Saracens via the open market to part mitigate the 30% tribute loss in food.
    
For (Saracens) Battle Elephant: 120 Food, 70 Gold  
  
This unit needs market fair price ratio set to 12:7 for food...  
  
Any 100 batch of food buy/sell made changes fair price by fixed amount of +/-3, (100-58)/3 = 1400 food to get ideal price  
  
Market price can be immediately be set by (pole) player asap with initial farms + dark age up gen after building market, focus is then for them to stay feudal and build max farms/stone-walls and maintain open market prices with as much food gen as possible, their objective is now to sell food to the (sarison) who also buy castle age food from open market at the 12:7 rate, as well as any additional food at this set price for later use in castle age troop prodction. Either way the saracens player focus is just to mine gold in feudal age onwards and to continue buying food from the open market.
  
Note gold tiles are scarce.  
  
Poles max intial food peak at feudal to set market price seem grim, say 10 farms (175 each no upgrades) surrounding 2 folwark can be made, thats only 175 initial food from the 10% + dark age, so not really viable strat to buy castle for the saracen.
