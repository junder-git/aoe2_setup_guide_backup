# How to use...
## Extrabutton2  
The idea is to spam mouse side button 1 (the easiest to reach at the front of the mouse, Extrbutton2) for villagers no matter the context.
The ui is a bit glitchy, but it selects all TCs if not selected already then proceeds to que vils on further button presses at a rate of one per press.  
  
ALSO it gives waypoint control every time the button is pressed, kinda meh feature    
  
ALSO if vills are docked in TC it will ungarisson them before you proceed to q further villagers per press (with right click as garison enabled)
  
## Extrabutton1  
The Extra button one works well with sending vils from TC back to work (with right click as garison enabled)  
it also can be used to cancel the way point being set on the Extrabutton2 spam end,  
when done spamming tap Extrabutton1 keeping current active way point unchanged.

### Poles to fling food to Saracen elephants via the open market.
True market value is refelcted as +/-5 for Saracens and +/-30 on any other civ -> Food sold by pole player exists to maintain the ideal elephant going rate for the saracen on open market, effectively meaning tribute cost of food is now only a 5% loss not 30% after the huge intial market investment by pole has been made (1400 food)... its a one way bargin for the saracen though and they need to exaust gold tiles to achieve this with an un-interupted open trade route.     
    
For (Saracens) Battle Elephant: 120 Food, 70 Gold  
  
So, unit needs market fair price ratio food:gold set to 100:58...  
  
Any 100 batch of food buy/sell made changes fair price by fixed amount of +/-3, (100-58)/3 = 1400 food to get ideal market true value price for elephants.    
  
Market prices will have to be set by (pole) before castle age elephant production is ready, focus is then for them to stay feudal and build max farms/stone-walls and maintain open market prices with as much food gen as possible to keep up with ongoing purchases from the saracen at the desired rate. Saracens player focus is to just mine gold in feudal age which (x) amount faster then food gen (quite a bit faster) from then onwards to continue buying food from the open market. -> Castle age 800 food cost come from where exactly is unsure atm, to calculate its self worth in this strats end game its probably valued at the same cost in food of the total army, so like army value and castle age food value 50:50 split, so to by food in market for castle might be worth more then elephants going rate... undecided here.    
  
Note gold tiles are scarce and can run out for saracen.  
  
Poles max intial food peak at feudal to set market price seem grim, say 10 farms (175 each no upgrades) surrounding 2 folwark can be made, thats only 175 initial food from the 10% + dark age, so not really viable strat to buy castle for the saracen.
