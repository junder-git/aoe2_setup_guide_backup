# How to use...
## Extrabutton2  
The idea is to spam mouse side button 1 (the easiest to reach at the front of the mouse, Extrbutton2) for villagers no matter the context.
The ui is a bit glitchy, but it selects all TCs if not selected already then proceeds to que vils on further button presses at a rate of one per press.  
  
ALSO it gives waypoint control every time the button is pressed, kinda meh feature    
  
ALSO if vills are docked in TC it will ungarisson them before you proceed to q further villagers per press (with right click as garison enabled)
  
## Extrabutton1  
The Extra button one works well with sending vils from TC back to work (with right click as garison enabled)  
it also can be used to cancel the way point being set on the Extrabutton2 spam end,  
when done spamming tap Extrabutton1 keeping current active way point unchanged.

## Team strat to test in-game... => Using a sell and buy food/wood model with just gold send.
2-player Burgundian castle age cavalier fling, poles to SELL-FOOD and SEND-GOLD for castle age end game push.
Need to test trial the impact on the universal market value drop of resource when receiving large initial quantity (checkspirtoflawvodmarketingmechs), the Burgundian player can then proceed to batch buy in smaller quantities from the pole player, hopefully done under the radar of the other team noticing global market prices of sed res (food) taking an significant drop.

By risking the open market prices in this way the 30% loss in food res sent could potentially be part mitigated by an 'indirect' tribute idea with gold received, to calculate how much total food needs to be sold by pole and in what manner for this to be efficient is determined by the initial food investment required for the optimal going food price at batch buy matched to the cost ratio of a single cavalier food:gold=50:35=10:7, plus the additional gold received at 30% loss to then either further batch buy food or create units to gain max gold:food quantity ratio for castle age unit spam of the cavalier.

Next day a few tests::- Needs to be (saracens civ) to (saracens-pole-hybrid) civ i.e. with market rates and initial food gen into resource gen debts in market food-gold fair price trade to get any value in this castle age push:  
  
First case::: player-1) send 100 food -> player-2) 70 food received  
  
Knight is 60 food 75 gold... So idea is to generate additional gold not additional food as well.  
But anyway, say its the other way around with 75 food and 60 gold or food>gold ratio op unit...  
   
Fair price ratio for this unit needs to be 4:3 so 100 food to 80 gold...  
Selling 100 batch of food drops fair price by fixed amount of 3 no matter total available res,  
So 700~ food send gets this to 100 food to 80 gold spend in fair price for intial market conditions to be set.  
  
After intial market setup, second case:::  
player-1) sells 100 food -> player-1) 76 gold recieved
player-1) sends 100 gold -> player-2) 70 gold recived 
Player ones focus is now on keeping fair market price at 4:3 food:gold every buy/sell made by selling food (100:76) sending the excess gold (76:54). -> 100 food from player one yeilds 54 gold for player TROOP ONLY gold, no re-buy food with. 
  
Player two can focus on fast gold generation which is how much faster then food gen (?!) i believe, so now any gold generated by player two now benifits from market ratio value to increase food production and simply buy food to reach optimal bank resource totals split, in this case 4:3 in their bank for max troop cretion. 

Note. Saracens-saracens cant work either and this is only made possible if food production can take the intial hit of maintaing market prices which most civs cant do, HOWEVER with the poles they recive intial farms food which means they arent constraint to food maintaing rates for the gold food purchase
