# How to use...
## Extrabutton2  
The idea is to spam mouse side button 1 (the easiest to reach at the front of the mouse, Extrbutton2) for villagers no matter the context.
The ui is a bit glitchy, but it selects all TCs if not selected already then proceeds to que vils on further button presses at a rate of one per press.  
  
ALSO it gives waypoint control every time the button is pressed, kinda meh feature    
  
ALSO if vills are docked in TC it will ungarisson them before you proceed to q further villagers per press (with right click as garison enabled)
  
## Extrabutton1  
The Extra button one works well with sending vils from TC back to work (with right click as garison enabled)  
it also can be used to cancel the way point being set on the Extrabutton2 spam end,  
when done spamming tap Extrabutton1 keeping current active way point unchanged.
  
## Strat potential to use feudal age eco civs initial food/wood bank to fling that res to ally Saracens civ through the open market under enemy radar insted of using tribute to minimise the 30% loss.             
Thought it was more then just 10% intial food farm bonus on the poles but eh...  
  
Example might be (Saracens) with (Pole support civ)     
  
For (Saracens) Battle Elephant: 120 Food, 70 Gold  
  
This unit needs fair price ratio set to 12:7 for food...  
  
Any 100 batch of food sell made drops fair price by fixed amount of 3,  
(100-58)/3 = 1400 food  
  
Poles max intial food peak at feudal, say 10 farms (175 each no upgrades) surrounding 2 folwark can be made, thats only 175 initial food from the 10% + dark age, almost better to just find the ideal dark age food only civ, so not viable strat cus no dark age market or stone wall either... pointless idea for now :c   
  
Maybe choosing an wood eco bonus civ to feudal age might provide a deccent enough of an intial fudal age wood bank to fling into Saracens for their ok-ish archers instead.
