# How to use...
## Extrabutton2  
The idea is to spam mouse side button 1 (the easiest to reach at the front of the mouse, Extrbutton2) for villagers no matter the context.
The ui is a bit glitchy, but it selects all TCs if not selected already then proceeds to que vils on further button presses at a rate of one per press.  
  
ALSO it gives waypoint control every time the button is pressed, kinda meh feature    
  
ALSO if vills are docked in TC it will ungarisson them before you proceed to q further villagers per press (with right click as garison enabled)
  
## Extrabutton1  
The Extra button one works well with sending vils from TC back to work (with right click as garison enabled)  
it also can be used to cancel the way point being set on the Extrabutton2 spam end,  
when done spamming tap Extrabutton1 keeping current active way point unchanged.

## Team strat to test in-game... => Using a sell and buy food/wood model with just gold send.
2-player Burgundian castle age cavalier fling, poles to SELL-FOOD and SEND-GOLD for castle age end game push.
Need to test trial the impact on the universal market value drop of resource when receiving large initial quantity (checkspirtoflawvodmarketingmechs), the Burgundian player can then proceed to batch buy in smaller quantities from the pole player, hopefully done under the radar of the other team noticing global market prices of sed res (food) taking an significant drop.

By risking the open market prices in this way the 30% loss in food res sent could potentially be part mitigated by an 'indirect' tribute idea with gold received, to calculate how much total food needs to be sold by pole and in what manner for this to be efficient is determined by the initial food investment required for the optimal going food price at batch buy matched to the cost ratio of a single cavalier food:gold=50:35=10:7, plus the additional gold received at 30% loss to then either further batch buy food or create units to gain max gold:food quantity ratio for castle age unit spam of the cavalier.

## Next day a few tests
Probably needs to be (saracens civ) to (saracens-pole-hybrid civ) i.e. support needs massive initial food bank from laying farms in feudal to provide initial market rates and the maintaining of gold resource gen-rates to buy further food from the supporting civ, to possibly get any value in this castle age push strat:  
  
Standard case::: any-civ-1) send 100 food -> any-civ-2) 70 food received... minimal time lost too.  
  
For a knight 60 food 75 gold the idea is to generate additional gold, but eh, say its the other way around with the desired civ-1 op castle age unit of 75 food and 60 gold with a food>gold ratio... (Try find op castle age unit)  
  
This specific unit fair price ratio needs to be 4:3 so 100 food to 80 gold market price...  
Selling 100 batch of food drops fair price by fixed amount of 3 no matter total available res,  
So 700~ food sell gets this to 100 food to 80 gold in fair price for initial market conditions to be set.  
  
After market setup, remaining (saracen-pole) feudal food bank to market interaction now equates to:::  
(100-food:76-gold)  
Player ones primary focus is now on keeping fair market price at 4:3 for food:gold for every buy made by ally...   
  
Note, in the case of a support to (sell food) -> (send gold) ::: (100-food:76-gold)->(76-gold:54-gold).  
The 100 food from (saracens-pole) yields 54 gold for player (saracens) in what is now TROOP ONLY gold, no re-buy food with.    
Player (saracnes) primary focus is now on gold generation to buy food with, gold being faster then food gen but scarce on the map, player (saracens) now benefits from market ratio value to increase food production with simply buying food to reach optimal bank resource amount for max castle age troop creation. (Note, up to the limit of the fuedal age saracens-pole civ food bank of initial farm lay plus catle age time up * food gen rates.)
  
Note. Initial food buy-in probs too much for (saracens-poles) civ to handle for setting market conditions and gold gen rates together, mass farm lay by (saracens-poles) to get max food fast to send from remaining fudal age to (saracens) castle age, means the resulting troop push in castle age from (saracens) has to be succesful, cus the current eco is effectively lowered by troop investment in (saracens) castle age with no food for (saracens-pole) to go castle themselves leaving stone wall defense to buy time for that intial (saracens) castle age army produce...  
  
Note. Often army will be made in fudaul or even dark age by some players.
