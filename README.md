# How to use...
## Extrabutton2  
The idea is to spam mouse side button 1 (the easiest to reach at the front of the mouse, Extrbutton2) for villagers no matter the context.
The ui is a bit glitchy, but it selects all TCs if not selected already then proceeds to que vils on further button presses at a rate of one per press.  
  
ALSO it gives waypoint control every time the button is pressed  
  
ALSO if vills are docked in TC it will ungarisson them before you proceed to q further villagers per press (with right click as garison enabled)
  
## Extrabutton1  
The Extra button one works well with sending vils from TC back to work (with right click as garison enabled)  
it also can be used to cancel the way point being set on the Extrabutton2 spam end,  
when done spamming tap Extrabutton1 keeping current active way point unchanged.

## Team strat to test in-game... => Using a sell and buy food/wood model with just gold send.
2-player Burgundian castle age cavalier fling, poles to SELL-FOOD and SEND-GOLD for castle age end game push.
Need to test trial the impact on the universal market value drop of resource when receiving large initial quantity (checkspirtoflawvodmarketingmechs), the Burgundian player can then proceed to batch buy in smaller quantities from the pole player, hopefully done under the radar of the other team noticing global market prices of sed res (food) taking an significant drop.

By risking the open market prices in this way the 30% loss in food res sent could potentially be part mitigated by an 'indirect' tribute idea with gold received, to calculate how much total food needs to be sold by pole and in what manner for this to be efficient is determined by the initial food investment required for the optimal going food price at batch buy matched to the cost ratio of a single cavalier food:gold=50:35=10:7, plus the additional gold received at 30% loss to then either further batch buy food or create units to gain max gold:food quantity ratio for castle age unit spam of the cavalier.
